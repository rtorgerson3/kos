      <h2>San Diego, California, USA</h2>

      />
      <p>
        San Diego best embodies laid-back California. Its surf culture,
        beckoning beaches, and postcard-perfect weather are enchanting. But
        don‚Äôt be fooled: San Diego is a major metropolis in its own right. Its
        serious food scene prides itself on a blend of Michelin nods and cheap
        eats‚Äîno trip is complete without a fresh fish taco in La Jolla. San
        Diego's a pure paradise for families, outdoor enthusiasts, and party
        people who love to bar-hop the thumping Gaslamp Quarter.

      <h2>Queenstown, New Zealand</h2>
      <img
        src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/080/487/original/Queenstown.png?1683237816"

      <p>
        Queenstown is as much a verb as a noun, a place of doing that likes to
        spruik itself as the 'adventure capital of the world'. It's famously the
        birthplace of bungy jumping, and the list of adventures you can throw
        yourself into here is encyclopedic ‚Äì from alpine heliskiing to
        zip-lining. It's rare that a visitor leaves without having tried
        something that ups their heart rate, but to pigeonhole Queenstown as
        just a playground is to overlook its cosmopolitan dining and arts scene,
        its fine vineyards, and the diverse range of bars that can make evenings
        as fun-filled as the days.
